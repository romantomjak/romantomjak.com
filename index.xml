      <description>I was working on an HTML website for a Go project and like always, I started by extending the NGINX image, but then it hit me&amp;hellip; what if I replaced NGINX with Go&amp;rsquo;s HTTP server?!
 Immediately after trying out this profane idea I run into an issue where by default you don&amp;rsquo;t get any HTTP logging facilities, but luckily this is very easy to correct using (you guessed it!</description>

      <title>Hetzner DIY Private Networking with tinc</title>

      <description>Hetzner has a reputation for offering a sweet price/performance ratio, however, in a true Unix philosophy, it comes at a cost of having to do everything by yourself. Including Private Networking. Normally you only get one public IP and no private interfaces. I suspect they might have some clever routing rules in place for traffic to never leave the DC, but somehow I don&amp;rsquo;t really fancy sending unencrypted traffic over public IPs.</description>

      <description>I often find myself tinkering with Go as it possesses many of the language qualities I like - statically typed, compiled language that in many ways is similar to C, but with memory safety and garbage collection.
 Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development technique that relies on very short, repetitive development cycles. Business requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved until tests are passing.</description>
