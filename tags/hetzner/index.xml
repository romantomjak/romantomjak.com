      <description>Hetzner has a reputation for offering a sweet price/performance ratio, however, in a true Unix philosophy, it comes at a cost of having to do everything by yourself. Including Private Networking. Normally you only get one public IP and no private interfaces. I suspect they might have some clever routing rules in place for traffic to never leave the DC, but somehow I don&amp;rsquo;t really fancy sending unencrypted traffic over public IPs.</description>
