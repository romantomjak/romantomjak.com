      <description>I often find myself tinkering with Go as it possesses many of the language qualities I like - statically typed, compiled language that in many ways is similar to C, but with memory safety and garbage collection.
 Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development technique that relies on very short, repetitive development cycles. Business requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved until tests are passing.</description>
