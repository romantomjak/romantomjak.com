discuss - custom field marshaling, excluding fields, curl examples</p>

<p>Golang has encoding/json package which is used for marshalling (converting objects into json) and unmarshalling (converting json into objects). In RESTFul APIs, you can read raw request bodies by accessing the Body field on a net/http.Request object. You can also write json to response output stream by passing the slice of byte that defines your json to the Write function of net/http.ResponseWriter object.</p>

<p>In the snippet below, I’ve implemented an endpoint which echoes request body back to the response stream after setting it’s time field to the server’s current local time.</p>

<p>You can access the full source code from my github repo here.</p>
