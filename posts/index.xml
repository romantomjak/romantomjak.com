      <description>Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re working for the worlds largest Wool Sock provider WOOSOK, handling on average 90k requests a day through your eCommerce platform of choice. It&amp;rsquo;s 11 AM on a Monday morning, you&amp;rsquo;re browsing Hacker News, when suddenly your boss Slacks you asking why &amp;ldquo;the website is slow&amp;rdquo;. You open the home page of WOOSOK and indeed, it took 8s to load the home page.
Twenty minutes later you&amp;rsquo;ve narrowed it down to a particular URL that when visited generates a list of all Purchase Orders ever created.</description>

      <title>Hetzner DIY Private Networking with tinc</title>

      <description>Hetzner has a reputation for offering a sweet price/performance ratio, however, in a true Unix philosophy, it comes at a cost of having to do everything by yourself. Including Private Networking. Normally you only get one public IP and no private interfaces. I suspect they might have some clever routing rules in place for traffic to never leave the DC, but somehow I don&amp;rsquo;t really fancy sending unencrypted traffic over public IPs.</description>

      <description>I often find myself tinkering with Go as it possesses many of the language qualities I like - statically typed, compiled language that in many ways is similar to C, but with memory safety and garbage collection.
 Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development technique that relies on very short, repetitive development cycles. Business requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved until tests are passing.</description>
